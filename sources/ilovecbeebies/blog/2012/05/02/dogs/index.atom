		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ilovecbeebies.tmpdir.eu/2012/05/02/dogs/"><![CDATA[<p><i>Something Special</i> is the only CBeebies program not to feature a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_on-screen_graphic#United_Kingdom">digital on-screen graphic (DOG)</a>. You know &#8211; those station logos that plague the corners of our screens on many (particularly digital) television channels. In the case of CBeebies the DOG is a CBeebies logo that occasionally flips over to reveal a CBeebies blob festooned with a rainbow.</p>
<p>The BBC says, &#8220;we believe it is important to ensure that viewers can quickly identify when they are watching a BBC service.&#8221; Does the absence of a DOG during <i>Something Special</i> imply that they don&#8217;t want people to identify that program with the BBC? That they&#8217;re not proud of their most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Special_(TV_series)#Awards">award winning</a> show?</p>
<p>More likely, it&#8217;s tacit acknowledgement that the DOG is annoying and degrades what is arguably the most important show that CBeebies broadcasts.</p>
<p>So we are spared from this annoyance during <i>Something Special</i>. Why can&#8217;t we be spared from it all the time?</p>
