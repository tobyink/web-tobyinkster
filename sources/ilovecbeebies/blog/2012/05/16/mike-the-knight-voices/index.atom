And from her website I found out who did the dragons&#8217; voices &#8211; each of which had been bugging me for a while as being semi-familiar.</p>
<p>Sparky is played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568801/">Colin McFarlane</a>, who brings a certain presence to whatever he&#8217;s in. You may recognise him if you&#8217;re a fan of <i>Torchwood</i>, or <i>Judge John Deed</i>, or <i>Reggie Perrin</i>.</p>
<p>And Squirt is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0869871/">Russell Tovey</a>, probably best known for <i>Being Human</i>, <i>Him &#038; Her</i> and <i>Gavin &#038; Stacey</i>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Colin McFarlane also plays Harrison in <i>Chuggington</i>.</p>
