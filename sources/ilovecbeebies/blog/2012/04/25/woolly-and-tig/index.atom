If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, it&#8217;s a five minute show that works on a very simple formula:</p>
<ol>
<li>The narrator (a slightly older Tig, looking back to when she was younger) explains &#8220;when I was very little&#8230;&#8221; and introduces something interesting she did.</li>
<li>Young Tig gets angry, anxious or afraid about the new experience.</li>
<li>Her toy spider &#8211; Woolly &#8211; comes to life and talks her through the experience.</li>
<li>She&#8217;s not angry/anxious/afraid any more.</li>
<li>An adult &#8211; usually somebody associated with whatever Tig was scared of &#8211; catches sight of Woolly out of the corner of their eye and is startled. Tig says &#8220;it&#8217;s only a toy spider&#8221;.</li>
<li>The narrator sums up how much she likes the new experience and ends with &#8220;I looooove Woolly&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, and everybody is Scottish. (Except Woolly for some reason.)</p>
<p>What do I like about it? There&#8217;s nothing I do not like about it. But some things I especially like are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main actors are genuinely related. Tig is played by Betsy McCredie; her dad is played by her real dad Colin McCredie (who is also in <em>Taggart</em>); her mum is played by her real aunt; the narrator is her older sister Maisie.</li>
<li>Tig is very sweet.</li>
<li>It does actually seem to have helped my three year old daughter over a few of her anxieties.</li>
<li>Everybody is Scottish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, they&#8217;ve made and screened 30 episodes, and we&#8217;re now into repeats. I do very much hope that the BBC decides to commission a second series. Some things my daughter is anxious about that could be made into episodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>having her hair brushed</li>
<li>roads that don&#8217;t have pavements</li>
<li>little brothers who insist on playing with your toys</li>
<li>parades</li>
<li>fireworks</li>
<li>caterpillars that look like they might jump onto your scooter</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps that last one is a little too specific?</p>
