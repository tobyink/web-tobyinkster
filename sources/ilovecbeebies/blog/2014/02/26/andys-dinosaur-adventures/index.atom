<p>The premise of the show is that Andy is now working in &#8220;the National Museum&#8221; (most of the interior shots seem to be from the Natural History Museum in London; some of the exterior shots look like the British Museum). Given the recent bad weather, leaving Pickles&#8217; Animal Park was probably a wise move. He frequently breaks and loses various exhibits. His solution is to use the museum clock to travel back to the time of the dinosaurs to obtain replacements. (It seems a simpler solution would be to travel back five minutes, and stop himself from destroying the exhibits in the first place!)</p>
<p>Anyway, these shows have proven very popular in our house. I wonder what the next career move will be for the intrepid Andy Day? Aquarium worker? Microbiologist?</p>
