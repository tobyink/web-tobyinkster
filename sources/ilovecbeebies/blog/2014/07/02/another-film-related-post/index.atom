<p>Two sisters who grew up in isolation from each other. One of them cute and warm-hearted. The other dresses in blue a lot, has white hair, is kinda magic, and is&#8230; shall we say&#8230; a little frosty. An unusual winter threatens the land. In trying to stop it from destroying the kingdom, the first sister is seriously injured by the cold. Only her icy sibling can save her.</p>
<p>Now I know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">what you&#8217;re thinking</a>, but actually I&#8217;m describing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_the_Wings"><i>Tinker Bell: The Secret of the Wings</i></a>. Despite being seemingly derivative of <i>Frozen</i> (at some point the writers <em>must</em> have bumped into each other in a hallway and inadvertently swapped ideas), it&#8217;s not a bad film. In fact, none of the <i>Tinker Bell</i> series is a bad film. (Even though they are Disney straight-to-DVD films, which is never a good sign.)</p>
<p>I think the thing I like the most about them is that Tinker Bell is a tinker. Her job in the fairy kingdom isn&#8217;t to deliver flowers, or tickle butterflies, or collect honey from bees. Instead, she makes stuff. With hammers. This seems like a good role model for young girls. Perhaps in another 15 years or so we&#8217;ll start to see an upswing in female applications for engineering courses.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m overestimating the impact that a series of straight-to-DVD films can have.</p>
