		<content type="html" xml:base="http://ilovecbeebies.tmpdir.eu/2014/03/16/vegetarianism-on-cbeebies/"><![CDATA[<p>For some reason, perhaps a reluctance to deal with <a href="http://ilovecbeebies.tmpdir.eu/2013/12/25/old-jacks-boat-christmas-special/">death</a>, virtually all characters on CBeebies are portrayed as vegetarian, even some unlikely ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doodles, the crocodile from <i>Tilly and Friends</i> eats mainly apples;</li>
<li>Captain Barnacles, Kwazii, Peso, and Shellington from <i>Octonauts</i>, despite being animals that would love a fishy snack (respectively: polar bear, cat, penguin, and sea otter) seem to survive mainly on seaweed, algae, and biscuits;</li>
<li>I have yet to see Big Bear from <i>Everything&#8217;s Rosie</i> attempt to eat Raggles; and</li>
<li>Even the humans and dragons in <i>Mike the Knight</i> seem to eat mainly berry pies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty much the only programmes that show or imply the consumption of meat (with the exception of nature programs like <i>Andy&#8217;s Wild Adventures</i>) and cooking shows (<i>I Can Cook</i> / <i>Big Cook, Little Cook</i>) are <i>Woolly &amp; Tig</i> (Tig eats fishfingers in several episodes), <i>Charlie &amp; Lola</i> (who eat sausages quite regularly), and <i>Peter Rabbit</i> (Peter and his friends under threat from Mr McGregor and Mr Todd).</p>
