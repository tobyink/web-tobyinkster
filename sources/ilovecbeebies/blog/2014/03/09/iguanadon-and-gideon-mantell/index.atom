<p>Gideon Mantell is credited with discovering the first iguanadon fossils, following the discovery of a fossil tooth by his wife. Mantell, who had been a keen fossil hunter since childhood, recognised it as too big to belong to any modern British herbivore, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Andy encountered iguanadons in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03x12v3/Andys_Dinosaur_Adventures_Iguanadon_Footprint/">episode 8</a>.</p>
