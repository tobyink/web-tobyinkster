While most of the action revolves around Postman Pat, his family, and various new characters introduced in the film, I was glad to see that all the old favourites were in there. I noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mrs Goggins (but no Bonnie?!?!);
<li>Alf, Dorothy &amp; Bill Thompson;
<li>Ted Glenn, who always seemed to be in the company of Amy Wrigglesworth (something going on there? I&#8217;d assumed he was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=only+gay+in+the+village&#038;tbm=isch">a bit Daffyd Thomas</a>);
<li>Ajay, Neesha &amp; Mira Bains;
<li>Rev Timms (who seemed more overtly religious than he is in the series);
<li>Dr Gilbertson, PC Selby &#038; Lucy Selby;
<li>Charlie Pringle (but not his dad, <a href="http://ilovecbeebies.tmpdir.eu/2012/07/08/whatever-happened-to-jeff-pringle/">to whom something unspeakable has happened</a>);
<li>Ben, Lauren &#038; Lizzy Taylor;
<li>Michael Lam; and
<li>Some of the characters from the 1980s who have been missing from our screens for many years &#8212; Major Forbes, Miss Hubbard, and (I&#8217;m fairly sure he was in the opening sequence&#8230;) George Lancaster.
</ul>
<p>Overall, a good film; not great (it was no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)"><i>Frozen</i></a>), but good. Much better than I expected it to be.</p>
