        <![CDATA[<p>Overall, I think the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-perl-7/">Perl 7</a> announcement is great news.</p>

<p>I only have one small objection:</p>
]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>One of the proposed changes is to remove</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Perl 4-style prototype definitions (use <code>:prototype()</code> instead)</i></p></blockquote>

<p>My objection to this is that <code>:prototype</code> was only introduced in Perl 5.20. Code using it won't work as expected on older versions of Perl.</p>

<p>The wording of this proposed change mischaracterizes the older sub prototype syntax as something Perl-4-specific, whereas the reality is that up until Perl 5.20, it was <em>the way</em> to declare prototypes.</p>

<p>This means that if I want my code to support Perl 7, I <em>need</em> to abandon Perl 5.18 and below, or jump through some fairly ugly hoops.</p>

<p>I don't like that.</p>]]>
