<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/TOBYINK/Exporter-Tiny-0.042/lib/Exporter/Tiny.pm">Exporter::Tiny</a> is a module I split out of the Type::Tiny distribution. It's an exporter, offering roughly the same capabilities as <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub::Exporter">Sub::Exporter</a>, but with a lighter footprint. I've not massively promoted it, but have been using it in a bunch of my other modules, and <a href="https://metacpan.org/requires/distribution/Exporter-Tiny">other people seem to have picked up on it and started using it too</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation requires a bit of work, but from my perspective the implementation is effectively complete. If you're using it, then I'd appreciate any feedback you have before it's "stable" and thus too late to change.</p>
