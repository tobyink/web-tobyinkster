<h3>Pork</h3>

<ul>
<li>2 pork steaks</li>
<li>2---3 tablespoons of dijon mustard</li>
<li>150g single cream</li>
<li>1/2 glass dry white wine</li>
<li>butter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accompanying vegetables</h3>

<ul>

<li>green beans</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>

<li>butter<br/>
 <br/>
h1. Method<br/>
 <br/>
Put 2 saucepans of water on to boil for the vegetables. Heat a little butter in a frying pan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the pork in the oil for about 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, put the new potatos in one of the saucepans to cook.</p>

<p>When the pork is done, take it out of the pan and leave it somewhere to keep warm. Add the cream, mustard and wine to the frying pan, stirring continuously. When thoroughly mixed, put the green beans into the second saucepan.<br/>
 <br/>
After about 4 minutes cooking, drain the beans. Put them back into the dry sauce pan with some butter and the garlic and fry for about 30 seconds. Put the beans and pork onto a plate. Pour the mustard sauce over the pork. Drain the potatos and put them on the plates as well. Put a large knob of butter onto the potatos and then season them with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</p></div>
