    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It was 40 years ago today that Douglas Engelbart gave a demonstration that introduced the public to an impressive list of technologies which would in the following years become established in the mainstream. On the 9th of December, 1968, he demonstrated:</p>

<ul>
<li>a mouse;</li>
<li>hypertext (i.e. text with links that can be followed -- a precursor to the Web);</li>
<li>e-mail; and</li>
<li>video conferencing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also demonstrates copy and paste, which although not completely new at the time, was still not especially common. A <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097">video of the demonstration</a> can be seen on Google Video.</p></div>
