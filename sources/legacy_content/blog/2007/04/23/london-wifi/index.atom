    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">square mile</a> now has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6577307.stm">Wi-Fi</a>. <em>The Cloud</em>, as it is called, is to be free for the first month, but after that there will be a charge.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Municipal_Wireless">San Francisco Municipal Wireless scheme</a>, and <em>the Cloud</em> starts to look fairly weak. In contrast with London's single square mile of coverage, the San Francisco scheme will cover a much larger area, and will be provided free of cost to the end user.</p>

<p>Compared to what they're rolling out in San Francisco, and many other US cities for that matter, <em>the Cloud</em> is just a glorified version of what's already running in every coffee house in South East England.</p></div>
