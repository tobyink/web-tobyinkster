    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Well, the <em>Life on Mars</em> finale was last night, and I thought it came to a brilliant conclusion. Sentimental without being too cheesy. It seemed to make sense of the whole series, but upon reflection, the big question, "am I mad, in a coma or back in time?" was left open.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">BBC </span>has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6542633.stm">news of a sequel</a>, <em>Ashes to Ashes</em> that should see Gene Hunt return to our screens next year. </p>

<p>David E Kelly is planning an <a href="http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2007/02/02/life-on-mars-american-style/">American remake</a>. You've got to wonder whether it will end up as another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28US_TV_series%29" title="US">Coupling</a> or achieving the rare accomplishment that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_%28US_TV_series%29">The Office: An American Workplace</a> managed. (The latter is even shown on British television, although not achieving anything close to the ratings of the original series.)</p>

<p>Farewell Sam Tyler!</p></div>
