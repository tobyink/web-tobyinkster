    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It seems that a couple of days ago <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera 9.2</a> <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/">was released</a>. That one passed me by -- I must start reading the opera.* newsgroups again.</p>

<p>The big new change is <a href="http://www.opera.com/img/products/desktop/screenshots/speeddial.jpg">Speed Dial</a> giving you even faster access to your nine favourite websites and one favourite search engine when you open a new (blank) tab. This is somewhat a replacement for the crappy old "Start Bar". Also, you get <kbd>Ctrl + 0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd> as hotkeys for the Speed Dial entries. Personally, I have found that Speed Dial slows things down a little, so I've turned it off. But if I had a faster computer (and I will soon, when my two new Intel 5060 Dual-Core Xeon processors get delivered) then I'd probably use it. Luckily, as with most things in Opera, there's a way to turn it off.</p>

<p>The screenshots-in-tooltips have improved somewhat and there are numerous security and bug fixes, including the annoying problem where the typed <span class="caps">URL </span>"foobar:1234" would be interpreted as "connect to server '1234' using protocol 'foobar'" instead of "connect to server 'foobar' on port '1234' using protocol 'HTTP'".</p>
