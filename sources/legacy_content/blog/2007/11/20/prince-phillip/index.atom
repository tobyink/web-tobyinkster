    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today, <span class="caps">HRH</span> Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh celebrate their diamond wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>Little known fact about Prince Phillip:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Yaohnanen believe Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh is a divine being, the pale-skinned son of a mountain spirit and brother of John Frum... When the cult formed is unclear, but sometime in the 1950s or 1960s. Their beliefs were strengthened by the royal couple's official visit to Vanuatu in 1974 when a few villagers had the opportunity to observe the prince from afar.</p></blockquote>
